# bloglist2
 In this exercis we refactored the Bloglist application that we worked on in parts 4 and 5 for it to use Redux for the application's state management.
 
 We assume that a user already exist in the database with the good credentials. If not, please head to part 4 for creating a new user using the API.
 
 # Start the application locally
 
 To start an application:

 First, you need to start the backend, to do so, head to the part4. Everything is explained in the README

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the frontend application
$ npm start

You can then access the app on : http://localhost:3000/
